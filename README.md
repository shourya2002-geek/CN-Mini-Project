# GUI BASED APPLICATION FOR GENERATION OF NETWORK PACKET PARSING LOGS


Packet parsing and identification is an essential and integral part of networking. Most devices that are part of the networking chain in our day to day lives perform some amount of packet decoding and reassembly while passing packets. This is especially important at the lower layers of the OSI model since more devices will need to access to the encapsulated data to determine were to transfer the packet.


In this project, we have implemented a basic program that performs packet parsing and identifies various application layer protocols. To this end, we have studied and come up with algorithms to parse or identify protocols at various parts of the OSI model. These include, the Ethernet layer, the IP layer, the transport layer as well as certain application layer protocols.
